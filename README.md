# karmochi
A playable version of the fictional board game karmochi. Game is played by running Karmochi.py

A Karmochi board is 15 squares long and 9 squares wide. The board is split into three zones, each 5 squares long; two defensive zones, one for each player, where the defensive pieces can be placed, and one shared attacking zone in the middle, where all attacking pieces sit.

Players start the game by choosing how many of their 7 pieces soldier pieces they want to use for attacking, and how many they want for defending, setting them down in the appropriate zones in specific starting formations depending on the number of each chosen.

Each play also has a single piece called the Knife or the Queen depending on location of origin. This guide will call it the Knife. The Knife piece starts in the center of the player's defending zone, on the fatherest row back, and is the only piece which can cross zones. The player's job is to move theirpieces around the board in order to get their Knife piece to the center squard of the opposingplayer's defensive zone.

A turn can consist of moving on edefending piece or one attacking piece up to two spaces in any direction, OR moving the Knife one space in any direction.

Attacking pieces force a knife piece to restart at its starting square if three opposing attacking pieces surround the Knife on three sides. Attacking pieces can also permanently destroy opposing attacking pieces by surrounding them on just two sides.

Defending pieces can block the Knife from reaching the goal, but can also keep their own attacking pieces from being destroyed. An attacking piece OR the Knife can not be destroyed of two of its own defending pieces are in the same of the 9 columns on the board.
